IMPORTANT:
My current plumbing and electrical drawings are only visual lines.
They are NOT truly connected networks.

Upgrade blueprint system to create REAL connected infrastructure networks.

====================================================
GOAL
====================================================

Implement REALISTIC plumbing and electrical systems where:

- every flat is physically connected
- pipes and wires follow logical routing
- flow animation shows movement
- looks like real engineering diagrams

====================================================
ARCHITECTURE
====================================================

Keep architecture layer separate.

Create:

src/utils/blueprint/
    plumbingNetwork.ts
    electricalNetwork.ts

====================================================
PLUMBING NETWORK (MANDATORY)
====================================================

Design true pipe routing:

1) One overhead tank on roof
2) One vertical riser pipe down all floors
3) For each floor:
     create horizontal branch
4) From branch:
     connect pipe to each flat bathroom/kitchen

Rules:
- bathrooms near shaft
- shortest path routing
- pipes always connected

Draw:
- blue lines
- small joints at intersections
- arrows for direction

Animation:
stroke-dasharray
stroke-dashoffset animation
simulate water flow

====================================================
ELECTRICAL NETWORK (MANDATORY)
====================================================

Design realistic wiring:

1) main meter at ground
2) vertical electrical riser
3) floor distribution board
4) branch to each flat
5) inside flat connect to switchboard

Rules:
- tree structure
- no floating wires
- always connected

Draw:
- yellow/orange lines
- nodes at panels

Animation:
faster dash animation to simulate current

====================================================
IMPLEMENTATION
====================================================

Both systems must use graph/tree logic:

source → branch → endpoints

NOT random lines.

Create helper:

generateNetworkPaths(nodes)

Then draw SVG paths.

====================================================
RESULT
====================================================

Final blueprint must show:

- architecture
- plumbing pipes with flowing animation
- electrical wires with flowing animation
- every flat connected
- looks like real civil/electrical blueprint
